<h1>Deanna's Favorite Movies</h1>
<h2>A few movies I highly recommend</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Field of Dreams</h3>
<p>I must admit I first watched this movie because Kevin Costner was in it. Turned out to be one of my favorite movies because it pretty much embodies the audacity of hope. "If you build it, they will come."</p>

<h3>Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>This is one of those movies that didn't get much attention until it won an oscar for best picture, I believe. The title was so weird to start off with, I think, that most people were disinterested. Must see. Again, another movie about hope</p>

<h3>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</h3>
<p>I mean, the books were amazing as we all know, and though most of the movies didn't quite live up to the books, for me Azkaban did.  POA was filmed and directed so well that I wished the same director stayed on to film the rest of the franchise. Cinematography was great as was character development.</p>
