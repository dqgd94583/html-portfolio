<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I have no formal education in design. Indeed I'm mostly self taught. Mind you I did this in an era pre-dating the internet so I do feel I've earned a spot in the roster, so to speak.</p>

<p>Learning design for me was borne out of necessity. Having decided to be a SAHM, I found my passion for creating things a welcome respite and, fortuitously, it eventually became a viable source of supplementary income for my family and me. Years of hands on experience and collaboration honed my design aptitude so I developed the ability to strike a balance between practicality, speciﬁcation compliance, and aesthetics, in no particular order. I ﬁnd my natural curiousity, resourcefullness, and predisposition to dissect details continuously enriches my design identity. Always equal to the task, I welcome any challenge, big or small, as it drives me to evolve, onwards and upwards, into an invariably better version of myself, designer or otherwise.</p>
